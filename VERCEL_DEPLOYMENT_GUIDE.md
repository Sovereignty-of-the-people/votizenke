# Deploying VotizenKE from GitHub Organization to Vercel

## Issue: Can't See Organization Repo in Vercel

When your repository is in a GitHub organization (not your personal account), Vercel needs explicit permission to access it.

## Solution: Grant Vercel Access to Your Organization

### Method 1: Through Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

#### Step 1: Go to Vercel
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"

#### Step 2: Configure GitHub Access
1. You'll see "Import Git Repository"
2. Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions"
   - **OR** look for a link that says "Configure GitHub App"
3. This will take you to GitHub settings

#### Step 3: Grant Organization Access (On GitHub)
1. You'll be on GitHub at: `github.com/settings/installations`
2. Find "Vercel" in the list of installed apps
3. Click "Configure" next to Vercel
4. Scroll down to "Repository access"
5. You'll see two options:
   - âšª All repositories
   - âšª Only select repositories
   
6. **Choose ONE:**

   **Option A: All Repositories (Recommended)**
   - Select "All repositories"
   - This gives Vercel access to all current and future repos

   **Option B: Specific Repository Only**
   - Select "Only select repositories"
   - Click "Select repositories" dropdown
   - Find and select: `Sovereignty-of-the-people/votizenke`

7. Click "Save"

#### Step 4: Back to Vercel

2. Refresh the page
3. Click "Import Git Repository" again

### Method 2: Direct GitHub App Configuration

2. Click "Configure"
3. **IMPORTANT:** Switch from your personal account to your organization

## Method 3: Using Vercel CLI

If the dashboard doesn't work, use the CLI:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/gondamol/gondamol/DemocracyOS/votizenke

# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? [Select your account or organization]
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? votizenke
# - Directory? ./ (current directory)
# - Override settings? No

# The CLI will deploy directly without needing GitHub access!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Can't See the Repo?

#### Check 1: Organization Membership
- Make sure you're an owner/admin of the GitHub organization
- Only owners can configure app permissions

#### Check 2: Vercel App Installation
1. Go to: `github.com/settings/installations`
2. Verify "Vercel" is installed
3. If not, install it:
   - Visit [github.com/apps/vercel](https://github.com/apps/vercel)
   - Click "Install"
   - Select your organization
   - Grant access

#### Check 3: Organization Settings
1. Go to: `github.com/organizations/Sovereignty-of-the-people/settings/oauth_application_policy`
2. Make sure Vercel is approved
3. If needed, approve it

#### Check 4: Refresh Vercel
- After changing GitHub settings, wait 1-2 minutes
- Refresh Vercel dashboard
- Try logging out and back into Vercel
